# ⌚ Chorus Capsule
ChorusCapsule is a Discord Bot that helps users store quotes in a "memory capsule" that they can access. By command, it can generate a random poem using past quotes (of a server, group chat, or dm).

# 💻 Commands
/create - create a portfolio to store quotes

/access - access a portfolio to make it active (this automatically creates a portfolio if the inputted portfolio is non-existent)

/delete - delete a portfolio

/add - add a quote

/count - get the amount of quotes in your portfolio

/export - export your quotes as a text message

/peek - peek at your latest quote

/pop - remove your latest quote

/random - get one of your quotes (randomly chosen 🎲)

/generate - generate a poem randomly and embrace the past! 📝

# 🖥 Technology Used
ChorusCapsule is coded mainly using Javascript. The quotes are stored in a JSON file. This discord app uses HTTP API for testing and NodeJS (installed). It runs on an Express server and utilizes ngrok for a public endpoint.
